TO DO:
-> update NaN on category status fetching => error fetching recent period data
   => adding an expense in a non-existent period should cause a new period result to be created
   => if the budget is non-existent too, copy the most recent budget for that category

-> update status for category cards upon expense creation
   => spent
   => percentage spent
   => starting amount for spending room
