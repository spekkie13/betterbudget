TO DO:
-> Adjust size of CategorySlotPickerModal to be less wide
-> Make the layout responsive instead of using hardcoded size formats
-> Unify handling decimal place separator comma doesn't work but a dot does

-> Add page to add/edit category budgets
-> Complete sign-up flow => alert user -> when OK -> show sign in page

-> Add in logic to fetch all members of a team and take their user ID into account when fetching all user-influenced data
-> Team Management (create a team, join a team, think out logic for fetching user related stuff by team)
